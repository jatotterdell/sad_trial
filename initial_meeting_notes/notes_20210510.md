- Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) platform trial
- Address key areas of uncertainties:

    - drug type
    - type of psychotherapy
    - frequency of sessions
    - concomitant meds SSRIs

- participants want the active therapy

- inclusion criteria LSAS (Leibowitz social anxiety scale) > 60 and endpoint also LSAS $\geq$ 35% improvment at week 8 after randomisation:
    - usual care expect 10% response
    - mean LSAS 97, SD 19
    - HIghly effective treatment response rate >40%.
