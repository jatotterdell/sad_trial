# Primary Outcome

The initial proposal listed the following primary outcome:

> Response – defined as ≥35% improvement in LSAS score at week 8

Additionally, an entry criteria for the study was listed as:

> Significantly unwell (Leibowitz Social Anxiety Scale, LSAS >60)

So, the primary outcome also defines one of the entry criteria.
This presents a risk of regression to the mean (e.g. those with LSAS > 60 at the time of screening may be at their worst and will inevitably have a lower LSAS in future just due to natural fluctuations).

There are inherent issues with change scores [see here](https://www.fharrell.com/post/errmed/#change) and [here](https://hbiostat.org/bbr/md/change.html).

Note point 1 in the first link - "the variable is not used as an inclusion/exclusion criterion for the study, otherwise regression to the mean will be strong". I.e. participants are enrolled when they're at their worst and might be expected to improve over time independently of treatment.

Recall, change over time is not "treatment response":

> The purpose of a parallel-group randomized clinical trial is to compare the parallel groups, not to compare a patient with herself at baseline. The central question is for two patients with the same pre measurement value of x, one given treatment A and the other treatment B, will the patients tend to have different post-treatment values? 

So, note that a $\geq$ 35\% improvement in LSAS from baseline is not of itself meaningful. What is meaningful is the relative LSAS at week 8 if given treatment A vs if given treatment B for a participant conditional on their baseline LSAS.

Better primary outcome: **baseline adjusted LSAS score at week 8 in group A relative to group B**.
